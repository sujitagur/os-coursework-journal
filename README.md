# Operating System Coursework Journal

This repository contains my coursework for the Operating Systems module.  
The project focuses on deploying, securing, monitoring, and evaluating the performance of a headless Linux server administered remotely via SSH.

Across seven structured phases, the coursework demonstrates system planning, security hardening, performance testing under different workloads, and final security auditing using industry-standard tools.

## Environment Overview

The coursework was developed and tested within a virtualised environment using Oracle VirtualBox.  
A dual-system architecture was implemented to reflect real-world server administration practices.

- **Hypervisor:** Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Server System:** Ubuntu Server (headless, security hardened)  
- **Workstation System:** Ubuntu Desktop  
- **Network Configuration:** Host-Only network for private administration  
- **Access Method:** Secure Shell (SSH)  

This setup ensures that all server configuration and monitoring tasks are performed remotely and securely.

## Demonstration Video

A short recorded demonstration accompanies this repository and is submitted via the official assessment platform.  
The video explains:

- System architecture and network design  
- Security configuration decisions and trade-offs  
- Performance testing methodology and observed system behaviour  
- Optimisation strategies and audit outcomes
